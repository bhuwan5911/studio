.# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running This Project Locally

To run this application on your own machine, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (which comes with Node.js) installed.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js version 18.x or higher installed. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Setup and Installation

1.  **Download the Code**: Download or clone the project files to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Open a Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command. This will read the `package.json` file and install all the necessary libraries for the project to run.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Running the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, and you'll see a message in the terminal telling you which local address it's running on, usually:

`ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:9002, url: http://localhost:9002`

You can now open your web browser and go to **http://localhost:9002** to see your application in action. The development server supports hot-reloading, which means that any changes you save in the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.
